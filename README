Visualizing an infinite spiral
to try to prove the every-lagoon-has-at-most-two-good-exits conjecture.


Priscilla and Dudley take a walk counterclockwise
all the way around the primal and dual perimeter respectively,
in such a way that whenever Priscilla is moving along an edge of the primal,
Dudley is stopped at the corresponding vertex of the dual,
and when Dudley is moving along an edge of the dual,
Priscilla is stopped at the corresponding vertex of the primal.
Exactly one of Priscilla and Dudley are moving at any particular time.

Denote D and P's positions, in rectangular and polar coordinates,
by the following, all continuous functions of time t:
    r_p,theta_p, x_p, y_p
    r_d,theta_d, x_d, y_d

    x_p = r_p cos(theta_p)  y_p = r_p sin(theta_p)
    x_d = r_d cos(theta_d)  y_d = r_d sin(theta_d)

Priscilla's and Dudley's paces are such that the one who's moving
always does so at unit rotation speed around the origin
while the other stays still.
So their positions are continuous piecewise differentiable functions of time,
with 
    (d theta_p + d theta_d) / dt = 1 wherever both are differentiable.

Since the combined rotational speed is 1 and the compned rotational distance
is 4 pi, it will take 4 pi units of time for Priscilla and Dudley
to complete on revolution and arrive back at their starting configuration;
if we fix Priscilla's starting point <x_p,y_p>(t=0)
in the interior (not endpoint) of some primal side, this forces Dudley
to start at the dual vertex <x_d,y_d>(t=0)
corresponding to that initial primal edge,
and the entire walk is thus determined.
They will arrive back at <x_p,y_p, x_d,y_d> at time t = 4 pi.

Priscilla and Dudley's walk is defined (modulo the choice of starting point)
no matter what the polygon.
Let's apply it to the case of interest: a polygon
with only one good lagoon exit.

Since the primal polygon is bounded by straight lines,
points on the boundary at local maximum and local minimum distance
from the polygon's cc are isolated,
and they alternate, with exactly the same number of local maxima
as local minima.
Furthermore by assumption there's exactly one local maximum
(at some farthest vertex);
therefore there's exactly one local minumum
(somewhere along the nearest side, *not* at a vertex),
which is therefore the unique global minimum.
We'll work in a coordinate system such that the cc
is at the origin <0,0>,
and the nearest point on the perimeter
is one unit below it, at <0,-1>.
For the dual (n another universe, at unrelated scale),
place the central vertex at the origin.
Then the dual edge corresponding to the primal edge closest to the origin
in primal space starts at the origin in dual space
and lies along the -y axis;
choose a scale so that it ends at <0,-1>.
Having chosen the position and scale of the dual,
the entire dual diagram (triangle complex) is thus determined.
It consists of n triangles, each having one vertex at the origin.

We'll number the primal features in CCW order:
primal edges have even indices and primal vertices have odd indices:
    e_0 = the bottom horizontal edge passing through 0,-1
    v_1 = right endpoint of e_0
    e_2 = next edge CCW
    v_3 = next vertex CCW
    ...
    e_{2 n - 2} = edge CW from e_0
    v_{2 n - 1} = left endpoint of e_0

Let m be the (odd) index of the vertex
that is the global maximum distance from the origin
of the entire primal polygon perimeter.
So v_m is the only good exit,
and distance-from=origin is strictly increasing
from <0,-1> around CCW to v_m,
and then strictly decreasing from v_m
back around CCW to <0,-1>.

Consider the directions of the "quill" emanating
from each vertex of this primal polygon.
Since v_m is the only good exit,
every quill *except* the one at v_m
points more towards the origin than away from it
(more precisely, the quill i's direction's dot product
with v_i is < 0), so it can't point directly out from the origin,
it must lean > 90 degrees from that, CW or CCW.
For v_i with i<m, distance from origin to perimeter is increasing,
so the quill at v_i can't lean CCW
(or it would point into the polygon's interior)
so it must lean at least 90 degrees CW from straight out.
Similarly for v_i with i>m, the quill at v_i
must lean at least 90 degrees CCW from straight out.

There is no apparent contradiction in anything described so far;
some possible cases are shown in Figures 1(a-e).
