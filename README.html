    Can't seem to adjust print font size by user :-(
    so messing with it in the style sheet here.

        oh no! and if I try to change version from 1.1 to 1.2 it says:
            Unsupported SVG version specified. This validator only supports SVG 1.1. The recommended way to suppress this warning is to remove the version attribute altogether.
    TODO: can I preprocess the preprocessed stuff so that _x and ^x mean \underline{x} and \overline{x}? YES! but make it nicer

    Content:

            For some reason printing comes out really tiny
            (even more in chrome than in firefox)
            if I don't make an explicit font size change.
            I don't know how to change font size for a particular printout,
            so hard-coding sizes in here.
            Font sizes:
                xx-small
                x-small
                small
                medium
                large
                x-large
                xx-large
            ARGH! anything media-specific causes corrupt output of math when printing in chrome!
            need to figure out why!
            printing in chrome seems pretty funky anyway (snap!) so I'll just print in firefox.

            ideal settings (when expressed outside @media) seem to be:
                firefox screen: medium (or large)
                firefox print: large (or x-large)
                chrome screen: large
                chrome screen: x-large
            but inside @media it acts different!
                - in chrome, mathjax max gets corrupt when printed
                - in firefox, @media print large
                  is bigger (and more to my liking)
                  than regular print large!
                  OH I think it's because the screen one leaked into 
                  the print one? some subtlety of the print previewer?
                  it's corrupt, too... didn't notice that before.

        To make the source of the proofs
        more readable and maintainable,
        the following preprocessing is done
        on all latex math (anything inside $...$'s or $$..$$'s)
        before feeding it to mathjax's tex processor.
        (In fact, rather than trying to detect where the $'s begin and end,
        we just do this on the whole darn document,
        hopefully excluding this explanation)
        1.
            Any of the following:
                _  ^  ^_  _^
            followed by any thing of the following:
                A B C D
                tp tm td
                rp rm rd
                xp xm xd
                yp ym yd
                 p  m  d
            get transformed into the respective one of
                \underline{thing}
                \overline{thing}
                \underline{\overline{thing}}
                \overline{\underline{thing}}
            (the latter two are effectively the same).
            (The _ and ^ go before the object rather than after,
            to avoid complication in parsing, for example, rd^2)
        2.
            The following:
                tp tm td
                rp rm rd
                xp xm xd
                yp ym yd
            get turned into, respectively:
                {\theta_p} {\theta_m} {\theta_d}
                {r_p} {r_m} {r_d}
                {x_p} {x_m} {x_d}
                {y_p} {y_m} {y_d}

        How to do this?
        Well, the following says there's a way to register a function
        as a preprocessor:
            https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mathjax-users/lWmbG9FClJs
        It says there's currently no way to get my preprocessor
        to run before the others, however mml2jax is the only extension
        that currently loads a preprocessor so it should be safe
        (DANGER-- might this change?)
        Davide also suggests making it a config file
        and loading it before original combined config file.

in such a way that whenever Priscilla is moving along an edge of the primal,
Dudley is stopped at the corresponding vertex of the dual,
and when Dudley is moving along an edge of the dual,
Priscilla is stopped at the corresponding vertex of the primal.
Exactly one of Priscilla and Dudley are moving at any particular time.
<div class="doMyThing">
<p>
Denote Priscilla's and Dudley's positions,
in rectangular and polar coordinates,
by the following, all continuous functions of time $t$:
<p>
\begin{align}
    rp,tp, & xp, yp \\
    rd,td, & xd, yd \\
    xp = rp \cos(tp)  \;\; & \;\;  yp = rp \sin(tp) \\
    xd = rd \cos(td)  \;\; & \;\;  yd = rd \sin(td)
\end{align}
<p>
Priscilla's and Dudley's paces are such that the one who's moving
always does so at unit rotation speed around the origin
while the other stays still.
So their positions are continuous piecewise differentiable functions of time,
with
    $$(d tp + d td) / dt = 1 \;  \text{wherever both are differentiable.}$$
<p>
Since the combined rotational speed is 1 and the combined rotational distance is
$4 \pi$,
it will take
$4 \pi$
units of time for Priscilla and Dudley
to complete one revolution and arrive back at their starting configuration;
if we fix Priscilla's starting point
$ \langle xp,yp \rangle (t=0)$
in the interior (not endpoint) of some primal side, this forces Dudley
to start at the dual vertex
$ \langle xd,yd \rangle (t=0)$
corresponding to that initial primal edge,
and the entire walk is thus determined.
They will arrive back at
$ \langle xp,yp\rangle,\langle xd,yd\rangle $ at time
$t = 4 \pi$.
<p>
Priscilla and Dudley's walk is defined (modulo the choice of starting point)
no matter what the polygon.
Let's apply it to the case of interest: a polygon
with only one good lagoon exit.
(We'll end up with a contradiction,
showing that, in fact, no single-exit single-polygon lagoon exists.)
<p>
Since the primal polygon is bounded by straight lines,
points on the boundary at local maximum and local minimum distance
from the polygon's cc are isolated,
and they alternate, with exactly the same number of local maxima
as local minima.
Furthermore by assumption there's exactly one local maximum
(at some farthest vertex);
therefore there's exactly one local minumum
(somewhere along the nearest side, *not* at a vertex),
which is therefore the unique global minimum.
We'll work in a coordinate system such that the cc
is at the origin
$\langle 0,0 \rangle$,
and the nearest point on the perimeter
is one unit below it, at
$\langle 0,-1\rangle$.
For the dual (at unrelated scale),
place the central vertex at the origin.
Then the dual edge corresponding to the primal edge closest to the origin
in primal space starts at the origin in dual space
and lies along the
$-y$
axis;
choose a scale so that it ends at
$\langle 0,-1\rangle$.
Having chosen the position and scale of the dual,
the entire dual diagram (triangle complex) is thus determined.
It consists of
$n$
triangles, each having one vertex at the origin.
</div> <!-- doMyThing -->
<p>
We'll number the primal features in CCW order:
primal edges have even indices and primal vertices have odd indices:
\begin{align}
            e_0 = & \text{the bottom horizontal edge passing through $\langle 0,-1 \rangle$} \\
            v_1 = & \text{right endpoint of $e_0$} \\
            e_2 = & \text{next edge CCW} \\
            v_3 = & \text{next vertex CCW} \\
                ... & \\
    e_{2 n - 2} = & \text{edge CW from e_0} \\
    v_{2 n - 1} = & \text{left endpoint of e_0} \\
\end{align}
<p>
Let
$m$
be the (odd) index of the vertex
that is the global maximum distance from the origin
of the entire primal polygon perimeter.
So
$v_m$
is the only good exit,
and distance-from=origin is strictly increasing
from
$\langle 0,-1\rangle$
around CCW to
$v_m$,
and then strictly decreasing from
$v_m$
back around CCW to
$\langle 0,-1\rangle$.
<p>
Consider the directions of the "quill" emanating
from each vertex of this primal polygon.
Since
$v_m$
is the only good exit,
every quill *except* the one at
$v_m$
points more towards the origin than away from it
(more precisely, the quill
$i$'s direction's dot product with
$v_i$ is
$\lt 0$), so it can't point directly out from the origin,
it must lean
$\gt 90^{\circ}$
from that, CW or CCW.
For
$v_i$
with
$i \lt m$,
distance from origin to perimeter is increasing,
so the quill at
$v_i$
can't lean CCW
(or it would point into the polygon's interior)
so it must lean at least
$90^{\circ}$
CW from straight out.
Similarly for
$v_i$
with
$i>m$,
the quill at
$v_i$
must lean at least
$90^{\circ}$
CCW from straight out.
<p>
There is no apparent contradiction in anything described so far;
some plausible examples are shown in Figures 1(a-e).

    On paper, I seemed to think the following was nice:

         .....*.....
         ...........
         ...........
         ..../.\....

         ../.*-*.\..
         ...........
         ...........
         .....X.....
    But the dual gets kind of extreme.
    Maybe the following is nicer (hexagon angles):
    In ShephardsPlayApplet:
         nVirtual=6
         1,1 1/1
         1,1 1/1
         and tweak the primal upwards on plane
         so that spiral becomes proper with respect to origin
         (maybe tweak by exactly half of dual edge)
    I'll enter it the simple way here,
    and then get ShephardsPlayApplet to spit out
    better coords.

These examples satisfy all the properties
of a single-exit single-polygon lagoon with the cc at the origin,
*except* that when we actually compute the cc,
we'll find it is not at the origin.
We now show that every attempt at a single-exit single-polygon lagoon
is doomed in this way--
that is, given any candidate primal polygon
and a point in its interior such that there is only one good exit
with respect to that point,
that point is *not* the cc of the lagoon.
<p>
The heavy lifting will be done by a lemma which we'll call
the Spiral Moment Lemma,
which states, roughly, that if a contiguous section of a polygon perimeter
is outwardly-spiral-shaped with respect to the origin
and all exits on this section are bad,
then the cc of this section is offset from the origin
in a direction lying strictly between that of the final (largest) position vector
and the corresponding final outward normal vector
(which are strictly less than
$90^{\circ}$
apart).
<p>
How that helps us is as follows:
a polygon with only a single good exit with respect to the origin
is naturally composed of two such sections
(outwardly spiraling in opposite directions)
plus the good exit.
Roughly, the Spiral Moment tells us
that the cc of each of these two sections
is offset from the origin roughly in the same direction as
(i.e. has strictly positive dot product with)
the good exit direction.
Therefore the cc of the whole polygon,
being a weighted average of these two cc's
and the position of the good exit vertex,
is likewise offset from the origin in that same direction,
and so cannot be the origin.
<p>
To be more precise,
let u be any nonzero vector
whose direction lies (not necessarily strictly)
between that of
$(v_m-v_{m+2})$
and
$(v_m-v_{m-2})$.
Any of the following will do:
\begin{align}
                   u = & (v_m-v_{m+2}) \\
    \text{or} \;\; u = & (v_m-v_{m-2}) \\
    \text{or} \;\; u = & \text{(the good exit quill direction)} \\
    \text{or} \;\; u = & \text{(the good exit vertex's direction from origin)} \\
\end{align}
or any other linear combination
$a(v_m-v_{m+2}) + b(v_m-v_{m-2})$
such that $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative and not both zero.
<p>
The important property of u is that the directions of each of the four vectors:
\begin{align}
    n^- = & \text{outward normal of last edge $e_{m-1}$ before (CW from) the good exit} \\
    p^- = & \text{position (minus origin) of last vertex $v_{m-2}$ before (i.e. CW from) the good exit} \\
    p^+ = & \text{position (minus origin) of first vertex $v_{m+2}$ after (i.e. CCW from) the good exit} \\
    n^+ = & \text{outward normal of last edge $e_{m+1}$ after (CCW from) the good exit} \\
\end{align}
is within
$90^{\circ}$
of the direction of u,
i.e. each of $n-,p-,p+,n+$ has positive dot product with u.
<p>
XXX get precise about this if I want to say it
Ultimately what this says is, if the internal angle at
$v_m$
is sharp, we've narrowed the direction of the cc (from the origin)
within a wide range (always smaller than 180 degrees though);
if the internal angle at 
$v_m$ is blunt, we've narrowed the direction of the cc (from the origin),
within a small range.
The range to which we've narrowed the cc's direction is precisely the supplement
of the internal angle at $v_m$.  See Figure XXX.
<div id="priscillaAndDudleyStuff" class="doMyThing">
<p>
We let Priscilla and Dudley compute the moment
by doing their walk around the primal and dual.
Priscilla starts anywhere in the interior of edge
$e_0$
and ends anywhere in the interior of edge
$e_{r+1}$.
Dudley starts and ends at the respective dual vertices.
(XXX maybe call them $v'_0$ and $v'_{r+1}$? yes I think so)
<p>
We consider an "event"
to be a moment during the walk
in which one or more of the following happen:
<ul>
    <li> Priscilla stops moving and Dudley starts moving
         (the first event is of this type)
    <li> Dudley stops moving and Priscilla starts moving
    <li> Dudley crosses the $x$ axis,
         from negative to positive $y$ coordinate
         (this will be a separate event
         iff no dual vertex lies on the $x$ axis).
         XXX this is no longer relevant, I don't think
</ul>
<p>
The accumulated moment vector starts as zero;
at each event at which Dudley has been moving,
Dudley computes the area of the triangle formed by
his previous event position, his current position, and the origin,
and adds
    $$(\text{Dudley's triangle area})*(\text{Priscilla's position})$$
to the moment vector being accumulated.
<p>
We'll prove the desired result
(that the moment of
$v_1..v_r$
has positive
$y$
coord)
by inductively proving that a stronger statement holds
at each moment in Priscilla and Dudley's walk.
The desired result follows from the following Lemma's
statement ($C$) at the end of the walk.
XXX why? need to be more specific
<p>
Spiral Moment Lemma:
During Priscilla's and Dudley's simultaneous walk around
the CCW-outward-spiraling part of the primal (starting with $e_0$)
and dual as described above, at all times strictly after the first event:
\begin{alignat*}{3}
    0 & \;\overset{(A)}\lt\;  &  rm & \;\overset{(B)}\lt\;  rp \, rd^2 \sin(tp-td) \cos(tp-td) / 2 \\
   td & \;\overset{(C)}\lt\;  &  tm & \;\overset{(D)}\leq\; tp \\
\end{alignat*}
<p>
Proof:
<p>
Note first of all the significance of the "after the first event"
in the Spiral Moment Lemma statement.
This clause is necessary because,
up to and including the first event
(Priscilla stopping at
$v_1$
and Dudley starting moving),
$rm = \|m\| = 0$,
and so ($A$) doesn't hold
(and ($C$),($D$) don't even make sense since
$tm$
isn't even defined).
<p>
Note also that
in any of Priscilla and Dudley's walks,
convexity of the primal polygon and the fact that it contains the origin
in its interior implies that, at all times,
Priscilla's position vector and her outward normal (right) vector
(which is in the direction of Dudley's position vector, by definition)
are strictly within
$90^{\circ}$
of each other.
In this strict spiral case (spiraling CCW outwards), we also know that
$td &lt; tp$.
So (C) and (D) are saying that
$tm$ lies in the half-open interval
$(td,tp]$ of size $< \pi/2$.
Combining this with ($A$),($B$),
the Lemma is saying that the moment $m$
lies in (or on the boundary of)
a certain pie-shaped region.
<p>
XXX maybe note geometric interpretation of ... that it's a triangle area, or cross product
<p>
We will prove the Lemma by induction on the number of events
(as defined earlier) encountered so far.
<p>
The base case will be the case when
the number of *previous* events encountered is
1.
(This includes all times strictly after the first event
up to and including the second event.)
That is, Priscilla has stopped moving at
$v_1$
(that was the first event)
and Dudley has been moving along the corresponding edge
$e'_1$
in the dual diagram.
At this time, the moment accumulated so far is simply
    $$(2) \;\;  m = (\text{Dudley's triangle area so far})*(\text{Priscilla's position})$$
which is a nonzero scalar times the nonzero vector
$p=v_1$,
so
$rm = \|m\| \gt 0$
(so ($A$) is satisfied, and
$tm$
is well-defined),
and
$tm = tp$.
So ($D$) holds, and ($D$) immediately follows
(since we always have $td < tp$ throughout any strictly CCW-outward spiral).
We still have to prove that ($B$) holds in the base case.
<p>
For this base case,
we temporarily rotate the entire picture
so that Priscilla's position
$p$
is on the
$+y$
axis,
and so Dudley is traveling upwards along the now-vertical dual edge
$e'_1$,
as shown in Figure 3.
Note that this temporary rotation of the picture
does not change the truth or falsity of ($B$) that we are trying to prove,
since all of the quantities
$rm$,
$rp$,
$rd$,
$tp-td$
are invariant under this rotation
(even though
$tp$
and
$td$
have changed-- specifically,
$tp$
is now
$\pi/2$).

        Figure 3: Base case, in temporarily rotated coord system
</pre>
We can get an upper bound on the area of Dudley's triangle so far,
as follows:
\begin{align}
    & \text{Dudley's triangle area so far} \\
    & \;\; = \text{area}(\triangle(0,v'_0,d)) \\
    & \;\; &lt; \text{area}(\triangle(0,\langle xd,0\rangle,d)) \;\; \text{since the former triangle is included in the latter, since $v'_0$ has $y$ coord &gt; 0 (XXX prove this!)} \\
    & \;\; = xd yd / 2 \\
    & \;\; = (rd \cos(td)) (rd \sin(td)) / 2\\
    & \;\; = (rd \sin(\pi/2-td)) (rd \cos(\pi/2-td)) / 2\\
(3) & \;\; = rd^2 \sin(\pi/2-td) \cos(\pi/2-td) / 2
\end{align}
<p>
Taking magnitudes of both sides of (2),
\begin{align}
   rm &amp; = (\text{Dudley's triangle area so far}) * rp \\
       &amp; &lt; (rd^2 \sin(\pi/2-td) \cos(\pi/2-td) / 2 ) * rp  \;\; \text{by (3)} \\
       &amp; = rp rd^2 \sin(\pi/2-td) \cos(\pi/2-td) / 2 \\
       &amp; = rp rd^2 \sin(tp-td) \cos(tp-td) / 2 \;\; (by XXX if I rearrange the above to state trivial facts first, like the other cases)
\end{align}
and so we've shown ($B$),
completing the proof of the base case.
<p>
For the inductive step,
we will show that, given two times
$\underline{t} \lt \overline{t}$
during the walk,
if only Priscilla moves or only Dudley moves during the that time interval,
and if the Lemma statement holds at $\underline{t}$, then it also holds at $\overline{t}$.
Since the walk leading to any desired target time
can be expressed as a finite number of steps of this form,
this will prove that the Lemma statement holds at all times.
<p>
Using underbars and overbars to denote the respective values
at times $\underline{t}$ and $\overline{t}$,
the inductive hypothesis is that the Lemma statement holds at $\underline{t}$:

\begin{alignat*}{3}
     0 & \;\overset{(_A)}\lt\;  &  _rm & \;\overset{(_B)}\lt\;  _rp \, _rd^2 \sin(_tp-_td) \cos(_tp-_td) / 2 \\
   _td & \;\overset{(_C)}\lt\;  &  _tm & \;\overset{(_D)}\leq\; _tp \\
\end{alignat*}
and, assuming that, we must prove that it holds at $\overline{t}$:
\begin{alignat*}{3}
     0 & \;\overset{(^A)}\lt\;  &  ^rm & \;\overset{(^B)}\lt\;  ^rp \, ^rd^2 \sin(^tp-^td) \cos(^tp-^td) / 2 \\
   ^td & \;\overset{(^C)}\lt\;  &  ^tm & \;\overset{(^D)}\leq\; ^tp. \\
\end{alignat*}
There are two cases.
<p>
Case 1: In the time from $\underline{t}$ to $\overline{t}$,
Priscilla has moved (in a straight line) and Dudley has stayed still.
<p>
This time we temporarily rotate the picture
so that Dudley's (stationary) position is on the
$+x$
axis,
and so Priscilla has travelled upwards along a now-vertical primal edge,
as shown in Figure 4.
As in the base case, this is simply a change of coordinate system
that does not change the truth or falsity of the Lemma at
$\underline{t}$
or
$\overline{t}$
(even though
$tp$
and
$td$
have changed-- specifically,
$_td$
and
$^td$
are now both
$0$).

        Figure 4: Inductive step, Case 1: Priscilla has moved
</pre>
XXX rearrange and use underoverline for all of the following, like in case 2
<br>
In this case we have the following relationships between the previous event's values
and the current values.
Dudley didn't move:
    $$(4) \;\; ^rd = _rd$$
    $$(5) \;\; ^td = _td = 0$$
nor did the moment (since the moment only changes when Dudley moves):
    $$(6) \;\; ^rm = _rm$$
    $$(7) \;\; ^tm = _tm  \;\; \text{(assuming $_tm$ is well-defined-- which it is, by inductive hypothesis)}$$
Priscilla moved purely upwards, within the first quadrant: (XXX may need to make very clear why this is true! it follows from C and/or D but it's a bit of a train wreck at the moment :-( )
\begin{align}
             0 & \lt _yp \lt ^yp \\
    (8) \;\; 0 & \lt _xp = ^xp
\end{align}
so her angle increased, but stayed less than $\pi/2$:
    $$(9) \;\; 0 \lt _tp \lt ^tp \lt \pi/2$$
   $$(10) \;\; 0 \lt \sin(_tp) \lt \sin(^tp) \lt 1  \;\; \text{(follows from (9) since $\sin$ is increasing in this range)}$$
   $$(11) \;\; 1 \gt \cos(_tp) \gt \cos(^tp) \gt 0  \;\; \text{(follows from (9) since $\cos$ is decreasing in this range)}$$
<p>
Proving ($^C$) is easy:
\begin{align}
    ^td & = _td  \;\; \text{by (5)} \\
                        & \lt _tm  \;\; \text{by} (_C) \\
                        & = ^tm  \;\; \text{by (7).}
\end{align}
Proving ($^D$) is easy:
\begin{align}
    ^tm & = _tm  \;\; \text{by (7)} \\
                        & \leq _tp  \;\; \text{by} (_D) \\
                        & \lt ^tp  \;\; \text{by (9)}
\end{align}
<p>
Proving ($^A$) is easy:
\begin{align}
    ^rm & = _rm  \;\; \text{by (6)} \\
                   & \gt 0  \;\; \text{by} (_A)
\end{align}
<p>
Proceeding now to prove ($^B$):
\begin{align}
    ^rm & = _rm  \;\; \text{by (6)} \\
                   & \lt _rp \, _rd^2 \sin(_tp-_td) \cos(_tp-_td) / 2  \;\; \text{by} (_B) \\
                   & = _rp \, _rd^2 \sin(_tp) \cos(_tp) / 2  \;\; \text{by (5)} \\
                   & = _rp \, ^rd^2 \sin(_tp) \cos(_tp) / 2  \;\; \text{by (4)} \\
                   & = (_rp \cos(_tp)) ^rd^2 \sin(_tp)/2   \;\; \text{(just rearranging terms)} \\

                   & = _xp \, ^rd^2 \sin(_tp)/2 \\
                   & = ^xp \, ^rd^2 \sin(_tp)/2   \;\; \text{by (8)} \\
                   & = (^rp \cos(^tp)) ^rd^2 \sin(_tp)/2 \\
                   & \lt (^rp \cos(^tp)) ^rd^2 \sin(^tp)/2  \;\; \text{by (10), since all factors are positive (by (10) and (11))} \\
                   & = ^rp \, ^rd^2 \cos(^tp) \sin(^tp) / 2   \;\; \text{(just rearranging terms)} \\
                   & = ^rp \, ^rd^2 \cos(^tp - 0) \sin(^tp - 0) / 2 \\
                   & = ^rp \, ^rd^2 \sin(^tp-^td) \cos(^tp-^td) / 2  \;\; \text{by (5)}
\end{align}
and so ($^B$) is proved,
completing Case 1 of the inductive step.
<p>
Case 2: In the time from $\underline{t}$ to $\overline{t}$,
Dudley has moved (in a straight line) and Priscilla has stayed still.
<p>
As in the base case, we work in a rotated coordinate system
in which Priscilla's (stationary) position is on the +y axis,
so Dudley is traveling upwards along a now-vertical dual edge,
as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Inductive step, Case 2: Dudley walks from $_d$ to $^d$.
 
<hr>
We denote quantities that are stationary at this step
by giving them both an underbar and overbar.
Priscilla is on the $+y$ axis and didn't move:
\begin{align}
                _^xp = & 0 \\
    (11.5) \;\; _^rp = & _^yp \gt 0 \\
    (12)   \;\; _^tp = & \pi/2 \\
\end{align}
Dudley moved northwest, strictly within the first quadrant:
(XXX may need more clarification, just like previous case)
\begin{align}
    (13) \;\; 0 \lt & _yd \lt ^yd \\
              0 \lt & _xd \lt ^xd
\end{align}
and his angle increased (XXX WHY??), but stayed less than $\pi/2$:
\begin{align}
    (14) \;\; 0 \lt & _td \lt ^td \lt \pi/2 \\
    (15) \;\; 0 \lt & \sin(_td) \lt \sin(^td) \lt 1 \;\; \text{(follows from (14) since $\sin$ is increasing in this range)} \\
    (16) \;\; 1 \gt & \cos(_td) \gt \cos(^td) \gt 0 \;\; \text{(follows from (14) since $\cos$ is decreasing in this range)} \\
\end{align}
The moment changed as follows:
\begin{align}
         ^m = & _m + (\text{area of Dudley's triangle}) * (\text{Priscilla's position}) \\
            = & \text{BAD ASSUMPTION HERE-- there is no }_^xd \\
    (16.5)  = & _m + (\frac{1}{2} * (^yd-_yd)*_^xd) * \langle 0,_^yp \rangle \\
\end{align}
Therefore by (12), the moment moved purely upwards;
furthermore ($_C$),($_D$) (and XXX) say it started strictly inside the first quadrant
so it ended there as well;
so ($^A$) is immediately satisfied and:
\begin{align}
    (17)  \;\;  0 & \lt _ym \lt ^ym \\
    (18)  \;\;  0 & \lt _xm = ^xm = _^xm \\
    (19)  \;\;  0 & \lt _tm \lt ^tm \lt \pi/2 \\
    (20)  \;\;  0 & \lt \sin(_tm) \lt \sin(^tm) \lt 1 \\
    (21)  \;\;  1 & \gt \cos(_tm) \gt \cos(^tm) \gt 0 \\
\end{align}
<p>
($^D$) follows trivially:
\begin{align}
            ^tm \lt & \pi/2 \;\; \text{by (19)} \\
                  = & ^tp \;\; \text{by (12)} \\
\end{align}
($^B$) is proved as follows:
\begin{align}
    ^rm = \|^m\| = & \|_m + (\text{area of Dudley's triangle}) * (\text{Priscilla's position})\| \\
             \le & \|_m\| + (\text{area of Dudley's triangle}) * \|_^p\| \;\; \text{by triangle inequality} \\
               = & _rm + (\text{area of Dudley's triangle}) * _^rp \\
             \lt & _^rp _rd^2 \sin(_tp-_td)\cos(_tp-_td)/2 + (\text{area of Dudley's triangle}) * _^rp \;\; \text{by ($_B$)} \\
               = & _^rp ((_rd \sin(_tp-_td))(_rd \cos(_tp-_td))/2 + (\text{area of Dudley's triangle})) \\
               = & _^rp (\text{area}(\triangle(0,\langle _xd,0 \rangle,_d)) + \text{area}(\triangle(0,_d,^d))) \\
             \lt & _^rp \text{area}(\triangle(0,\langle ^xd,0 \rangle,^d)) \;\; \text{since this tri strictly contains the disjoint union of the previous two} \\
               = & _^rp rd^2 \cos(^td)\sin(^td) / 2 \\
               = & _^rp rd^2 \sin(\pi/2-^td)\cos(\pi/2-^td) / 2 \;\; \text{since $\cos(t)=\sin(\pi/2-t)$ in general} \\
               = & _^rp rd^2 \sin(_^tp-^td)\cos(_^tp-^td) / 2 \;\; \text{by (12)} \\
\end{align}
So that proves ($^B$); all we have left to prove is ($^C$).
<p>
For this, we first derive an intermediate result
from the inductive hypothesis.
The "all terms positive" claims throughout the following
follow from ($_A$),($_C$),($_D$).
\begin{align}
 _rm \sin(_tp - _tm) = & _rm \sin((_tp-_td)-(_tm-_td)) \\
                     = & _rm (\sin(_tp-_td)\cos(_tm-_td) - \cos(_tp-_td)\sin(_tm-_td)) \;\; \text{by double-angle identity} \\
                     = & _rm \sin(_tp-_td)\cos(_tm-_td) - _rm \cos(_tp-_td)\sin(_tm-_td) \\
                   \lt & _rm \sin(_tp-_td)\cos(_tm-_td) - 0 \;\; \text{since all terms positive} \\
                   \lt & _rm \sin(_tp-_td) * 1 \;\; \text{since $\cos(_tm-_td) \lt 1$ and all terms positive} \\
                   \lt & (\frac{1}{2} _rp _rd^2 \sin(_tp-_td)\cos(_tp-_td)) \sin(_tp-_td) \;\; \text{by} (_B) \\
                     = & \frac{1}{2} _rp \cos(_tp-_td) (_rd \sin(_tp-_td))^2 \\
                   \lt & \frac{1}{2} _rp (_rd \sin(_tp-_td))^2 \;\; \text{since $0 \lt \cos(_tp-_td) \lt 1$} \\
                     = & \frac{1}{2} _rp (_rd \sin(\pi/2-_td))^2 \;\; \text{by (12)} \\
                     = & \frac{1}{2} _rp (_rd \cos(_td))^2 \\

\end{align}
In this Priscilla-aligned coordinate system, that's the same as saying:
\begin{align}
                                         _xm &lt; & \frac{1}{2} _rp _xd^2; \;\; \text{that is,} \\
       (22) \;\; \frac{1}{2} _rp _xd^2 - _xm &gt; & 0.
\end{align}
(XXX could phrase that in terms "$m \times p \lt \frac{1}{2} (d \times p)^2$",
coordinate-free til the last second, if we wanted... maybe)
<p>
Now we proceed to prove ($^C$).
Since $^d$,$^m$,$_d$,$_m$ are all in the first quadrant,
our goal ($^C$) can be expressed as
    $$(^C') \;\; ^d \times ^m \gt 0$$
and assumption ($_C$) can be expressed as
    $$(_C') \;\; _d \times _m \gt 0$$
(where $\times$ denotes the scalar cross product
of two vectors in the plane; that is,
the determinant of the
$2 \times 2$
matrix whose rows are the two vectors).
<p>
So we just need to prove ($^C'$) and we're done.
\begin{align}
    ^d \times ^m = & \langle _^xd,^yd \rangle \times \langle _^xm,^ym \rangle \\
                 = & _^xd ^ym  -  ^yd _^xm \\
                 = & _^xd (_ym + \frac{1}{2} (^yd-_yd) _^xd _^yp) - ^yd _^xm \;\; \text{by (16.5)} \\
                 = & _^xd (_ym + \frac{1}{2} (^yd-_yd) _^xd _^yp) - (_yd + (^yd-_yd)) _^xm \;\;\;\; \text{since $^yd = _yd + (^yd-_yd)$} \\
                 = & (_^xd _ym - _yd _^xm) + (^yd-_yd) (\frac{1}{2} _^xd ^2 _^yp - _^xm) \;\;\;\; \text{(just rearranged terms)} \\
                 = &          _d \times _m          + (^yd-_yd) (\frac{1}{2} _^xd ^2 _^yp - _^xm) \\
               \gt &             0             + (^yd-_yd) (\frac{1}{2} _^xd ^2 _^yp - _^xm) \;\; \text{by ($_C'$)} \\
                 = & (^yd-_yd) (\frac{1}{2} _^xd ^2 _^yp - _^xm) \\
                 = & (^yd-_yd) (\frac{1}{2} _^xd ^2 _^rp - _^xm) \;\; \text{by ($11.5$)} \\

               \gt & 0, \;\; \text{by (13) and (22).} \\
\end{align}
So ($^C'$) is proved, completing the induction
and the proof of the Spiral Moment Lemma.
